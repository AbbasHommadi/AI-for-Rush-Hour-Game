Finding an optimal solution to rush hour puzzle is easy but finding best algorithm or heuristic to solve these puzzles is difficult.  \r\n\r\n# Introduction\r\nRush hour game is sliding block puzzle game. It invented in the 1970s by Nob Yoshigahara. The board size of the game is 6x6 and contains only two types of vehicles. First vehicle type has length of two blocks and second vehicle type is a truck that has length of three blocks. Each type can move either horizontally or vertically and none of vehicles can move both direction. The target vehicle is a horizontal car in row 2. The goal is to move the target vehicle to the exit (out of the board). Where each puzzle has its own configuration, so finding a way to move the target vehicle to the exit is not an easy because you have to figure out how to clean the way to the exit. My project focuses on implementing A* with different heuristics to solve the game and make a comparisons between these heuristics.\r\n![Puzzle description](https://github.com/AbbasHommadi/AI/blob/master/rh_description1.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n# Motivation\r\nThe motivation of this project is finding an optimal solution for puzzles like rush hour is an easy job but finding faster and cleverer search is difficult. As well learning Artificial intelligence techniques through games that we are interested in is really fun way to master things.\r\n\r\n# Method\r\nStep1: generated random puzzles with different number of vehicles.\r\n\r\nStep2: Implementing Hill Climbing method to find harder puzzles (e.g. puzzles take longer steps to solve). The following figure show the hardness of puzzles before and after applying hill climbing.\r\nFigure2  \r\nStep4: Apply A* star algorithm with different heuristics to solve the puzzles\r\n\r\n\tThe heuristics that I have used are:\r\n\r\nH0: Zero heuristics. Here the A* acts like BFS.\r\n\r\nH1: Distance from target vehicle to the  exit.\r\nFigure3\r\n\r\nH2: blocking heuristic e.g. count number of vehicles that block the way to the exit\r\nFigure3\r\n\r\nH3: lower bound blocking which is H2 plus the minimum number of vehicles that block these vehicles in H2.\r\nFigure4\r\n\r\n## Reference\r\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rush_Hour_%28board_game%29","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
